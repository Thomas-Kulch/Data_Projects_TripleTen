In this project, I will be demonstrating my skills on Exploratory and Statistical Data Analysis using a video game data set from 2016.

I will be preparing a campaign to forecast 2017 sales based on this data.

The goal will be to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not.

I plan to:
1. Read the data
2. Prepare the data (transform, fill missing values, remove duplicates, add necessary columns)
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Create a profile for each region in the dataset
5. Perform Statistical Data Analysis
6. Report on my findings
